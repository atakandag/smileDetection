# smileDetection
Detection of smiling and unsmiling face by using CNN

##Training

You can train your own model  by running [preProcess_training_testing.py](https://github.com/atakandag/smileDetection/blob/main/preProcess_training_testing.py)

##Testing with Camera

You can test your trained model by running [webcam_testing.py](https://github.com/atakandag/smileDetection/blob/main/webcam_testing.py)

##Reference
Below is the paper used for the CNN architecture.
